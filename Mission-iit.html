				WHO ARE WE?
			</h3>
			<p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;"> 
				We are the first school oriented organisation of India which is going to offer readymade
				packages for students in school campus only. Our faculties are well screened from IITs, NITs,
				IIEST, JU and the other elite universities of India. Our motivation is to lead young pupil for the
				future India in a school oriented environment. MISSION-IIT & NEET is for students of students in all
				aspects. Our faculties are researching for all the topics of entrance exams to make our assets
				updated for AIM IIT or AIM AIIMS and ACHIEVERS courses. This very mission is for
				helping the third world pupil to go high and higher.
			</p>
			
			<h2  style="font-size: 40px">
				WHAT WE DO?
			</h2>
			<p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;">
				Our faculties previously worked in reputed Institutes in India so we are aware of mind-set, brain
				capacity and skill of every category of students from any background. There is no such organisation 
				except us who can give the tremendous service to the students in such a minimum course fee at friendly
				homogeneous school atmosphere. We generally share not only educational knowledge but also provide career
				counselling sessions to make the students always focused. Our way of teaching is always friendly that can never
				be a burden for the pupil.
			</p>

				WHY IS IT A MISSION?
			</h4>
			
			<p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;"> 
			Students are the builder of the Nation. There are many students those who think big but fail to reach their goal due
			to lack of facilities as well as due to lack of awareness of different career perspective. MISSION IIT will show them path
			to serve the Nation successfully.
			</p>
			<p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;">
			Some students have higher IQ and much more brain capacity but they don’t have the ideas what is going
			on outside the atmosphere where he/she lives. They don’t have even the conceptual idea how the question 
			comes at competitive exams like IIT-JEE(Main & Advance) or NEET. 
			MISSION-IIT & NEET will support them to go ahead and to take the lead in front.
